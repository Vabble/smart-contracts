# smart-contracts
Requirements:

- The contract should allow for the exchange of the old VAB tokens to the new VAB tokens.
- The contract should be upgradable, so you can periodically add new VAB tokens to it.
- The contract should include a function that allows only the contract owner to withdraw the swapped old VAB tokens.
- The contract should include security measures, like preventing re-entrancy attacks, limiting gas usage, checking for integer overflows and underflows.
- The contract should include event emitters to provide a way to track the transactions, such as swaps made, tokens added, and withdrawals.
- The contract should follow standard best practices of Solidity smart contract development and should be compatible with the Polygon Network.
- The contract should be tested thoroughly, including unit tests, integration tests, and if possible, should be audited for security.
